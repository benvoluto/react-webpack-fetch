# react-webpack-fetch
Some boilerplate files for react + webpack + fetch for external data

This is a dev only set of files for doing basic things with React, Babel 6, SCSS, Webpack, hot reloading, and external data via Fetch, because I found no ready-made examples.

###To do local development

npm install
npm start
```
